ChatPDF API  
The ChatPDF API allows users to programmatically extract information from PDF files and create custom chatbots based on those PDFs. With this service, you can add PDFs via URL or file upload, interact with the content through chat, and manage your PDF sources effectively.

To authenticate with the ChatPDF API, you will need to generate an API key. This key is essential for making requests to the API endpoints. The documentation does not provide a specific link for generating the API key, so please refer to the official ChatPDF website or contact their support for detailed instructions on obtaining your API key.
